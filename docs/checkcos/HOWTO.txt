# Want to compare RML-380Z-* original listing with the assembled listing.

# Get z80asm-compatible source file from original listing
perl process-source.pl RML-380Z-Monitor-v2.3.txt > monitor.asm

# Grab binary from original listing
grep -E '^[0-9A-F]{4}   [0-9A-F]' RML-380Z-Monitor-v2.3.txt | grep -v 'DEFM' | cut -c1-13 | cut -d\  -f1-4 > original-binary.lst

# Assemble source derived from listing
z80asm monitor.asm -lgen.lst

perl process-listing.pl gen.lst > gen-binary.lst

vimdiff original-binary.lst gen-binary.lst

# The differences should be:
# 1. z80asm generates '00' in listing for DEFS, which the original listing omits (as areas are not initialised by default)
# 2. z80asm omits DEFB characters from listing (annoying)
